# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: "Star Wars" }, { name: "Lord of the Rings" }])
#   Character.create(name: "Luke", movie: movies.first)
# puts "Cleaning up database..."
# Idol.destroy_all
# puts "Database cleaned"

# user_idol = User.create(
#   name: Faker::Name.name,
#   email: Faker::Internet.email,
#   password: Faker::Internet.password(min_length: 6)
# )

# user_idol = Idol.create(
#   name: Faker::Artist.name,
#   power: Faker::Superhero.power,
#   address: Faker::Address.full_address,
#   description: Faker::Superhero.descriptor,
#   price: Faker::Number.decimal(l_digits: 2)
# )
